      "A wedding set against the Himalayan foothills carries a different kind of magic — the light falls differently, the air feels cleaner, and every photograph carries the mountains in the background.",
      "The first step is choosing a venue that can host both the intimacy of your rituals and the scale of your reception. At Kumar's Palace, our 10,000 sq.ft banquet space is designed to do exactly that — flexible enough for a small mehendi and grand enough for a full wedding reception.",
      "Next, think about your guests' journey. Chaula, Hamirpur offers a convenient setting for families travelling from across Himachal Pradesh and beyond, while still feeling relaxed and private.",
      "Finally, give yourself time with your venue's team. The best weddings are the ones where décor, dining and logistics are planned together, not separately.",

    content: [
      "A single banquet hall can host three or four completely different atmospheres within 24 hours — a bright, floral mandap for the morning ceremony, a relaxed lounge setup for the afternoon, and a dramatic, lit stage for the evening reception.",
      "This transformation depends on careful planning: seating layouts, lighting rigs, floral installations and catering flow all need to work in sequence rather than in isolation.",
      "At Kumar's Palace, our banquet team walks every family through this sequence in advance, so that on the day itself, everything simply happens — leaving you free to enjoy your own wedding.",

      "Not every celebration is a wedding — anniversaries, engagement ceremonies and milestone birthdays all deserve venues and teams that take them just as seriously.",
      "A well-run banquet space should be able to scale down gracefully: warm lighting, a smaller floral footprint and a more intimate dining setup, without losing any of the elegance.",
