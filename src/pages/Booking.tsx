        This page outlines the general booking process for weddings,
        banquets, events and stays at Sai Kirpa & Garden.

      <h2>How Bookings Work</h2>
      <p>
        All wedding, banquet and event dates are confirmed on a
        first-enquiry, first-confirmation basis, subject to availability.
        We recommend enquiring as early as possible, especially for peak
        wedding season dates.
      </p>
      <h2>Check-in & Check-out</h2>
      <p>
        Standard check-in time is {SITE.checkIn} and check-out time is{" "}
        {SITE.checkOut}, unless otherwise arranged with our front desk team.
      </p>
      <h2>Confirming Your Booking</h2>
      <p>
        To confirm a wedding, event or stay booking, please contact our team
        directly at{" "}
